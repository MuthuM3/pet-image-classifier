### Introduction
In recent years, the field of computer vision has witnessed remarkable advancements through deep learning techniques. Image classification, particularly in distinguishing between different types of animals, has become increasingly important for various applications, from pet identification in shelters to automated pet door systems. This project focuses on developing a robust classification system specifically for distinguishing between cats and dogs, two of the most common household pets.

The challenge lies not only in achieving high accuracy but also in creating a system that can generalize well across different breeds, poses, and lighting conditions. Our solution employs modern deep learning architectures and techniques to address these challenges effectively.
